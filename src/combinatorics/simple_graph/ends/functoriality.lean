Sufficiently nice maps between graphs induce maps between connected components.
In other words, there is a functor from the category of simple graphs with appropriate morphisms
to the category of sets, taking each graph to its set of connected components.

The required maps between graphs are cofinite (maps that pull back finite sets to finite sets) weak homomorphisms 
(maps that send reachable pairs of points to reachable pairs of points).
